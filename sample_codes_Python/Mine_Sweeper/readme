*The mine sweeper game follows the traditional rule of the one in the old Windows version.
*It is still under testing but if you would like to play the preliminary version, the rule is as follows:
Rule:
Each time on the command line, input x, y, R, where x and y represents the location, and 'R' means 'reveal the cell'. 
If you stepped on the mine, game is over. If not, the updated mine with revealed cells will be printed on the screen. If you would like to flag the cell, 
you can type x, y, F, where x and y are coordinates, and 'F' means 'flag the cell'. After all the mines are successfully flagged, game is over and you win.

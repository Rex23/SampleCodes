Keywords:

1. count(*) over(partition by team_id)
2. group_concat(distinct(product) order by product asc separator ',')
3. order by product asc
4. IFNULL(sum(quantity), 0)
5. order by travelled_distance desc, name asc
6. left(order_date, 7)
7. count(distinct customer_id)
8. select cast(order_date as varchar(7)) as month ? (check its accuracy)
9. where invoice > 20
10. round(sum(units*P.price)/sum(U.units),2)
11. 'Case' usage:
Examples:
https://www.w3schools.com/sql/func_mysql_case.asp

CASE
    WHEN condition1 THEN result1
    WHEN condition2 THEN result2
    WHEN conditionN THEN resultN
    ELSE result
END;

Example 1:
SELECT CustomerName, City, Country
FROM Customers
ORDER BY
(CASE
    WHEN City IS NULL THEN Country
    ELSE City
END);

Example 2:
select id, 
	sum(case when month = 'jan' then revenue else null end) as Jan_Revenue,
	sum(case when month = 'feb' then revenue else null end) as Feb_Revenue,
	sum(case when month = 'mar' then revenue else null end) as Mar_Revenue,
	sum(case when month = 'apr' then revenue else null end) as Apr_Revenue,
	sum(case when month = 'may' then revenue else null end) as May_Revenue,
	sum(case when month = 'jun' then revenue else null end) as Jun_Revenue,
	sum(case when month = 'jul' then revenue else null end) as Jul_Revenue,
	sum(case when month = 'aug' then revenue else null end) as Aug_Revenue,
	sum(case when month = 'sep' then revenue else null end) as Sep_Revenue,
	sum(case when month = 'oct' then revenue else null end) as Oct_Revenue,
	sum(case when month = 'nov' then revenue else null end) as Nov_Revenue,
	sum(case when month = 'dec' then revenue else null end) as Dec_Revenue
from department
group by id
order by id

12. round(100 * sum(order_date = customer_pref_delivery_date) / count(*),2)
13. sum(order_date = customer_pref_delivery_date)
14. count(*)
15. min(event_date)
16. self join examples:
Example:
select min(a.x - b.x) as shortest
from point a, point b
where a.x > b.x
Example:
SELECT MIN(ABS(P1.x - P2.x)) AS shortest FROM point AS P1
JOIN point AS P2 ON P1.x <> P2.x

17. union

Example:
SELECT name, population, area
FROM World
WHERE area > 3000000 
UNION
SELECT name, population, area
FROM World
WHERE population > 25000000

613. Shortest Distance in a Line (I did not figure out this. self join. re-do!!!!)
1173. Immediate Food Delivery I (I did not figure out this. re-do!!!)
1179. Reformat Department Table (I did not figure out this. sum is necessary. See the reason in the first post discussions. re-do!)
1303. Find the Team Size 
Solution:
Window function? 
select employee_id, count(*) over(partition by team_id) as team_size
from employee


Structured Query Language

MySQL is a relational database management system

*PopSQL is also needed; a program works like a text editor hooked up to MySQL

*Tutorial:

*Installation of MySQL on Windows:
52:29
MySQL community server
MySQL 5.7 Command Line Client
PopSQL hostname: localhost
port: 3306
1:15:50 (creating tables)

*create database giraffe;

*
SELECT employee.name, employee.age
FROM employee
WHERE employee.salary > 30000;

*INT
DECIMAL(M,N) #M, total digits, N, digits after the decimal point
VARCHAR(1)
BLOB
DATA
TIMESTAMP

Classic problems:

797. All Paths From Source to Target (This is very important! Back tracking. Re-do!!!!!!)
1135. Connecting Cities With Minimum Cost (Krushkal's algorithm implemented by sorting and union find. Very important. Did not see this kind of graph problem before. Re-do!!! Note that for sort, give reference in lambda function can significantly improve speed!)

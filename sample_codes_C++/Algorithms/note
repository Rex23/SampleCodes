*Remembered problems:

1. The rainfall volumes between the mountains

2. randomly shuffle an array of numbers

3. rvalue reference

4. hash table

*Problems 503, 1475 in Leetcode:

Similarity: find the next element which is greater or smaller than the current one. The complexity in space and time can be O(n). 

*string's length: .length()

*10 ways to convert a char to string in C++:

*std::vector does not have push_front

*<cstdlib> (stdlib.h)

*random number generator:
#include <time.h>  
srand(time(NULL)); 
int j = rand() % max_number; //generate a number between (0, max_number - 1)  

*reverse loop through an array:
wrong: for (size_t i = a_vector.size(); i >= 0; i--)
correct: for (int i = a_vector.size(); i >= 0; i--)

*char and integer correspondance:
'A' <-> 65
'a' <-> 97

*the middle element:
Given an array with size n. If n is odd, n / 2 will give the exact middle element and if n is even, n / 2 will give the right one of the middle two elements.

*string find_first_of, find_last_of:
while (i < j) {
    i = s.find_first_of("aeiouAEIOU", i);
    j = s.find_last_of("aeiouAEIOU", j);
    if (i < j) {
        swap(s[i++], s[j--]);
    }
}

*std::swap

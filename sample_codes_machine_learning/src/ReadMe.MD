├── ML_Class_3rd_Project           # This is a class project I did at Georgia Tech for the graduate CS class of machine learning. The goal is to train the dnn for letter recognition with a reduced feature dimension.
								   # I first used PCA, ICA, RCA, and LLE methods respectively to reduce the feature dimension, and then built a deep neural network manually using Tensorflow to make predictions.
								   # Different initialization and activation strategies for the dnn are investegated.
